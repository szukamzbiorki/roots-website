    Everything that exists and grows has its roots.<br>
    What does this mean to a designer or individual?<br>
    <br>
    Roots are shared, yet particular and individual. Plants have roots, tribes and groups have certain roots. Yet, what exactly are roots? Roots as a concept is connected to many different levels of (more than) human activity. The social, the spiritual and the structural for instance. In our ever-changing world, understanding their influence can become a catalyst for recognizing one’s own position between the past, present and the futures.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="outline">ROOTS</span> is a block-long project with third-year graphic design students from the Royal Academy of Art, The Hague. They developed new works in various formats, with diverse narratives, all presented in a collective exhibition on the 11th of October from 16:30 until 20:00 at KABK Gallery 1&2. By researching, modifying, and reflecting on their own roots, they are testing the capacity of the term itself and visualizing its implications on our lives.<br>
    <br>
    <span class="outline">ROOTS</span> is a result of Image and Philosophy classes guided by tutors <span style="white-space: nowrap;">Katrin Korfmann</span> and ​​<span style="white-space: nowrap;">Maarten Cornel.</span>
