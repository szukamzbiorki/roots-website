    <p>In her work, Jeremejeva explored her own alienation from her birthplace, Latvia. Moving to a completely different country, she experienced extreme homesickness, but every visit back home never felt the same, as she felt that she was only a guest.</p>
    <p>In the summer of 2022, when Diana went home for two weeks and visited the countryside where she spent all her childhood summers, she realized that it will never be like it used to be. Suddenly everyone and everything felt completely alien. Questions about where her home is now and why it doesn’t ever feel good to return to Latvia anymore really started troubling her.</p>
    <p>For one to feel good where they live, they should make a home of their new surroundings. This is precisely what Diana is exploring in her installation ‘I’m Home’. What is left of her old home is only a warm memory of her childhood, the beautiful nature, countryside, home in question, Putnu iela, all portrayed in the drawings hanging on the wall and the view out of the window as a glimpse of the past, in her new room in The Hague.</p>
