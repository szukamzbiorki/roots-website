    <p>In this work Kosse explores his roots through the different landscapes of his homeland, Mauritius. He has sculpted Oiseau, a clay and metal creature based on dozens of extinct birds, endemic to the Mascarenhas Archipelago. Owing to its geographic location and centuries of colonialism, the birds resampling pays tribute to the ethnic and cultural diversity of the Mauritian people.</p>
    <p>Through the gaze of this hybrid creature, he visits the stories of colonialism, immigration and exploitation. The soundscape refers to the relentless pain and exhaustion subjected to the African, Malagasy and Indian slaves. His work is a story of human perseverance and triumph.</p>
