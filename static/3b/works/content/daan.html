    <p>In his installation Jonker explores the concept of connection through the metaphor of water. Reflecting on his own roots for this project Jonker investigated the connections he shared with those that are close to him.</p>
    <p>
        This work is an exploration of how different ways of connection can influence us. Jonker creates a striking resemblance between connection and water. Fluids are tangible and yet intangible. This is on the contrary to solid objects, where movement is not present.</p>
    <p>Jonker is juxtaposing the flow of liquids with the flow of the relations, even though it is intangible. The optical illusion of the two faces visualized in his video installation function as a container for the fluidity of an old connection. The accompanying poem is an attempt to capture connection through spoken word.</p>
