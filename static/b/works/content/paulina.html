    <p>In ‘Abandonment’ Cywoniuk explores her roots in relation to abandonment and trauma, which is present in her family for several generations. She engages in conversation with her mother and grandmother by creating a digital space. She intends to create a safe space for dialogue despite the physical distance that divides them. She asked her mother and grandmother to 3D scan their faces remotely and united them in the exhibited animation along with her own 3D scanned face.</p>
    <p>In the video you hear voices of the three participants, talking about their experiences concerning being abandoned in their childhood by one of their parents, how they cope with this trauma and how it influences their lives. Cywoniuk attempts to open a conversation about and analyse repetitive family patterns transferred from generation to generation. With special attention paid to her own experience with being left by her father and how her family members reflect on it. The emotional piece offers a therapeutic journey of healing.</p>
