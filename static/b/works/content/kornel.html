    <p>Through his work, Wojcinowicz explores the connection between past and present symbols of belonging.
        In the past, noble families were entitled to claim their coat of arms, a symbol representing their status and heritage. As the popularity of shields rose, formerly excluded groups were designing their own shields.</p>
    <p>Wojcinowicz is referring to these identity marks as a reminder of existence and belonging and that the outlook of status and social groups is still represented by signs and labels.</p>
    <p>His installation is an attempt to create a new abstract shield referring to traditional arms. Wojcinowicz is marking people’s urge for social belonging by introducing modern symbols and remixing medieval ones.</p>
