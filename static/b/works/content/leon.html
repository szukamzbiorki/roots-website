    <p>With this project, ‘Where is me’ de Bruijn takes the freedom to re-imagine our current understanding of the inner body in a creative and imaginary way, inspired by old medical drawings, from times when little was known about the inner body.</p>
    <p>His creation of the body is depicted as a complex system that is always in processes of: digesting experiences, growing, healing, moving, transforming form, and much more. Furthermore, while making Leon investigated which parts of our inner body play different roles in these magical processes and how this can be physically represented within his process of creation.</p>
