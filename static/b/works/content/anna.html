    <p>Marcussen’s work ‘My Little Breeder’, explores gender norms, performativity and how kids are continuously born directly into a world made by and for males. It starts with Marcussen’s personal observations and memories and her continued curiosity to understand why the world is the way it is. With help from feminist authors (Ursula K. Le Guin and Donna Haraway) and new courage she included her experience as the truth and hereby presents her contribution to keep the dialogue and criticism of gender equality alive.</p>
    <p>
        The installation consists of more than 30 kilos of clay. The material is chosen because it is sustainable and can survive for many years from now. That way it will keep on telling the story of our contemporary society. Some of the clay is shaped as vases in several different shapes, some clay is shaped into a relief.</p>
    <p>
        The vases intend to symbolize not only labour and trial, but are also a carrier of the story and visual representation of the process of learning and ongoing curiosity. The latter is heavily inspired by the publication ‘The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction’ by feminist science fiction author Ursula K. Le Guin. The relief that compliments the vases is a representation of Marcussen’s fragmented memories and her understanding of being a kid in her formative years in Denmark in the early 2000’s.</p>
