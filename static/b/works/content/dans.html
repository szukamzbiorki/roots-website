    <p>This project is an attempt to understand the artist’s historical background and how to navigate it. National identity, culture, environments, mentalities, routines, limitations are all root causes for his behaviour and tendencies.</p>
    <p>
        While thinking about his changing position in the world and personal development in recent years, he collected small rocks to study and magnify, as he did with his own pieces of history. In the process he researched current subjects, like globalisation and stagnation, that concern concepts of ‘back home’.</p>
    <p>
        These large rocks, with many details, texture and their solid state are a metaphor of the artist’s Latvian identity, which serve as a basis for his future, as cornerstones do for a house. The continuous change of placement of the rocks represent the different influences, presence and implications one’s core values can have on themselves. The title of the installation also implies: history stays, but you have a choice to alter the results.</p>
