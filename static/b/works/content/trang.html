    <p>A night lamp made out of duvets. Entering the night lamp means entering the home of reminiscence.</p>
    <p>The project is Trang’s first attempt to visualize a mental safe space – a specific childhood memory: the moment when she was lying on the bed next to her grandma, there was a night lamp with dim light on the wall. After more than 20 years, Trang’s memory, though the sensations vividly nest in her brain, has been disfigured over time: she was lying on the bed next to her grandma, inside the night lamp with dim light on the wall where infinite tranquility exists along with absolute silence. The title ‘Of A Constant Dream’ is referring to the ever-changing existence of that memory.</p>
    <p>By inviting people to visit the space inside the duvet night lamp, Trang presents a juncture where one can relive their memory of a very simple moment they never forget.</p>
