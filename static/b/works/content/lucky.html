    <p>Kim’s work reflects on the growing and bending of roots. She emphasises that Roots can migrate to another place and make connections with their new surroundings. There are no borders for roots, they can travel freely, but while they settle in a place and enrich themselves, commitment is necessary.  And through the years, this commitment blooms and bears fruits, resulting in achievements.</p><p>The journey of migration, devotion and achievement of roots is repetitive, starting at the end and ending in the beginning, like a circle of life. Kim expresses this as a map, depicting her life journey, her dedication and achievements.</p><p>Each ‘life journey’ is connected and has a close relationship with each other, like a puzzle. The sizes of her puzzle pieces vary but are always connected and together they shape a unique whole. Like in society, one doesn’t exist without the other, as embodied by Kim as she plays her game in the exhibition.</p>
