    <p>Jiye Kim, who was born in the 1990’s, is a Millennial. In the 2000’s this generation is described as the only generation to experience both analogue and digital media in their teens. This generation is not afraid of using digital items. However, at the same time, Kim misses the days when she used non-digital types of equipment or early digital items that seem to be less precise. Her nostalgic memories have already faded or mingled in her brain, resulting in vague memories that remind her about her childhood. In her installation, Kim wants to express the concept of loss. The project is a personal archive of tools mixing analogue and digital, expressing her nostalgia.</p><p>The title ‘Millennium bug of Memory’ refers to the term ‘the millennium bug’ which is a name describing a computer problem of not being able to correctly deal with data transfer from one millennium to the next.</p>
