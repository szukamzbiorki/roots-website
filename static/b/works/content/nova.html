    <p>‘11 Things You Have In Common With Nature’, explores cycles, change, nostalgia and coming back to the ‘natural world’ with all its beauty and complexity. Nova intends to show us the interconnection of all living things as well as our own place in nature.</p>
    <p>In her installation she playfully depicts natural cycles of life and death, day and night and the four seasons. Decomposition, hibernation, reproduction, adaptation, reactions and metamorphoses are elements illustrated in her 3D animation. Here, the cyclic changes happen all at once, playing out on a circular landscape, in a never-ending loop.</p>
    <p>She experiments with a set of dualities: natural-artificial, continuity-brittleness, fragile-solid. She aims to underline the tensions between nature and technology. Lie uses the images of flowers, insects, water and leaves in her works to celebrate and romanticise an eco-centric worldview and to remind us of our relationship with nature.</p>
