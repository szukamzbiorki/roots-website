    <p>Reflecting on roots as a system of habits created by our ways of working and interacting in society. R.G.B. analyses the legacy of colonial exploitation of people and resources in Argentina through moving image. In her video she is bringing forth the side-effects of neo-environmentalism that is shaping our environment and human-nonhuman relations and perpetuating inequalities by the destruction of the environment. The GMO (genetically modified organism) invasion of agribusiness giants in South America set in place a colonial development model, where the nation reverts to relying on exporting a single cash crop to First World nations and finally is left with the devastating impact of monoculture, displaced rural populations, nutrient depleted soil, loss of biodiversity, and poisoned communities. Throughout Argentina, there have been reports of intoxication from the herbicide glyphosate which is heavily used to protect transgenic crops.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, her film is reflecting on a study made by the Socio-Environmental Interaction Space (EMISA) of the University of La Plata, Argentina, explaining that 85% of cotton in personal care products contain glyphosate. In 2015 the World Health Organization declared the herbicide a probable carcinogen.</p>
    <p>This project aims to play with the absurdity of pervasive chemicals, hiding in items you entrust with your health as a side effect of biotechnology progress.</p>
