    <p>Many researchers have hunted down the metaphor of a spiral for centuries. The spiral is present everywhere in our environment, manifesting itself as matter that can be either visible or invisible to the human eye. It is a symbol that can be found in most cultures throughout millennia. Spirals are also well known as being used for hypnosis and can be traced in magic rituals across a variety of spiritual belief systems, stretching from ancient times.</p>
    <p>Matveyko is inspired by the spiral as a great representation of the Hermetic dictum ‘As above, so below…’. As she points out, it weaves magic from the micro level to the macro. In a similar manner Hermetic writers believed that all phenomena including humanity itself contained something divine on a small scale, being thus a reflection of the endless mass of the universe and higher power.</p>
    <p>Matveyko’s installation is constructed out of a collection of spirals engraved in wooden disks. It functions as an invitation to trace the eternal levels that the concept exists on. QR-codes link to Wikipedia pages that associatively relate to or directly describe each example of a spiral. The installation offers a space for play and reflection, the disks are easily unmountable for closer inspection or can be spun in circles to create entrancing patterns.</p>
